    <p>Amisa knew she was prone to daydreaming and zoning off at inopportune times. It wasn’t unusual for her to get 
        lost in her head dreaming up cute picnic dates for her ships or epic battle scenes or the perfect reply to 
        arguments that she never got into or that one time when she totally embarrassed herself in front of her crush back in middle school… you get the idea.<br>
But having vivid hallucinations about assassination attempts (that she knew hadn’t happened, come on, 
        everyone knew The High Lady had been lost at sea) in the middle of her midterms seemed a bit much even for her.

    <p>“Seriously, how long is this gonna take?” whined Rashmi as Amisa dragged her through the bookshop aisles.</p>
    <p>“Well, Arnaa Harrison just released a new book, and Ramon   suggested a book that’s apparently about Yananian myths. I haven’t found them yet though, so yes, its gonna take a while.” Amisa replied half-distracted as she read through the blurb of a thriller book. It wasn’t usually her taste, but this one sounded interesting.</p>
        <p>Rashmi sighed. “You know what, I think I’ll get a coffee next door. You want anything?”</p>
        <p>“Na, I’m good, I’ll meet you there in a while”</p>
